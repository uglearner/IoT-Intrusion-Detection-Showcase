# IoT Intrusion Detection using Machine Learning

🚀 **Showcase Repository (Demo Version)**  
This project demonstrates my research work on evaluating different Machine Learning algorithms for IoT intrusion detection.  

⚠️ Note: This repository contains only a **demo version** (safe for public viewing).  
The **full dataset and complete implementation** remain private to prevent misuse.
